## Problem Statement

Farmers in India and across the world often face exploitation from intermediaries who purchase their produce at very low prices and later resell it at much higher rates in the market. This unfair practice leaves farmers with minimal earnings, while consumers are forced to pay inflated prices for the same goods.

Challenges in the current agricultural supply chain include:

* **Lack of Price Transparency:** Farmers often have no access to real-time market prices, and consumers have limited visibility on fair product costs. This creates an information gap that benefits middlemen the most.
* **Limited Market Access:** Small-scale and marginal farmers struggle to sell directly to consumers or retailers due to logistical, infrastructural, and technological constraints.
* **Perishability of Crops:** Many agricultural products are highly perishable. Without proper storage and timely sales, farmers are forced to sell at distress prices, leading to financial losses.
* **Consumer Concerns:** Consumers often lack assurance regarding the freshness, quality, and authenticity of the produce they purchase.

This broken system primarily benefits intermediaries, causing financial loss and inefficiency for both farmers and consumers. There is a clear need for a **transparent, reliable, and direct farmer-to-consumer solution** that empowers farmers while ensuring quality and fair pricing for consumers.
